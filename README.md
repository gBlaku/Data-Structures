 In here you'll find some projects I worked on in my Data Structures course. Enjoy!! :grin: <br/> <br/>

These are all class projects. Classes are provided in the assignment download by the department, (SOME) drivers as well, which are added for convenience (drivers are NOT made by me). Test cases files are also provided by the department, or made my be and classmates. <br/>
<br/>
**My work is typically done in the file that shares the name of the folder, e.g, Polynomial.java for the Polynomial folder.** <br/>
These can be found in the respective src folders, or down **below!**:  <br/>


* **[Polynomial.java](https://github.com/gBlaku/Data-Structurescs112-/blob/master/Polynomial/src/poly/Polynomial.java).** <br/>
* **[LittleSearchEngine.java](https://github.com/gBlaku/Data-Structures-cs112-/blob/master/Little%20Search%20Engine/src/lse/LittleSearchEngine.java).**<br/>
* **[Friends.Java](https://github.com/gBlaku/Data-Structures-cs112-/blob/master/Friends/src/friends/Friends.java)** <br/>
* **[Trie.java](https://github.com/gBlaku/Data-Structures-cs112-/blob/master/Trie/src/Trie/Trie.java)** <br/>
